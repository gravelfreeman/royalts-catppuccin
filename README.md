# royalts-catppuccin

I decided to replace Termius due to their excessive monthly pricing and started exploring RoyalTS. I was particularly keen on getting the Catppuccin theme for it. Hopefully, this helps someone out there!

[!] Currently only supporting LattÃ© flavour. Feel free to submit a PR with the missing flavours.

### Powershell Colors

I'm currently working on the Powershell and WSL colors for Windows. Unfortunately it's poorly documented. The best way is to use the new Windows Terminal but unfortunately I wasn't able to add it in RoyalTs. I hope they'll support this in the future because the older PowerShell versions are getting less and less supported.
